---

## ❌ Issues That Need to be Fixed

### 1. **Product Type Field Should Be Removed**
- **Issue**: Product Type field is still present in the form and being sent to server
- **Location**: 
  - Form state: line 356
  - Form submission: line 2095
  - Form display: Need to find and remove
- **Required Action**: Remove productType field from form completely

### 2. **Printing Options Should Be Dynamic (Attribute-Based)**
- **Issue**: Printing Options are hardcoded in the filters section
- **Location**: `client/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` (lines 3401-3769)
- **Current Implementation**: Hardcoded table for printing options
- **Required Action**: 
  - Remove hardcoded printing options section
  - Make printing options use dynamic attributes instead
  - Allow admins to create "Printing Option" as an attribute type

### 3. **Validation Issues - Inconsistent Required Fields**
- **Issue**: Validation rules are inconsistent between create and edit modes
- **Location**: `client/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` (lines 1996-2041)
- **Problems**:
  - Required fields validation checks `selectedType` but form also has `productType`
  - Validation for edit mode may be too strict
  - Required fields indicator shows 6/6 but validation may fail
- **Required Action**: 
  - Fix validation to be consistent
  - Ensure required fields are the same for create and edit
  - Fix the required fields progress indicator

### 4. **500 Server Error on Edit**
- **Issue**: Server returns 500 error when updating product
- **Location**: `server/src/controllers/productController.js` (line 452)
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Server-side validation may be rejecting valid data
  - Missing or incorrect field handling in updateProduct
  - FormData parsing issues
- **Required Action**: 
  - Review server-side validation in `updateProduct`
  - Ensure all fields are properly handled
  - Check error logs for specific validation failures

### 5. **Bold Button Redirect Issue (Likely Resolved)**
- **Issue**: Clicking Bold button in description editor redirects to home page
- **Status**: ⚠️ Likely Resolved (CKEditor is now used instead of RichTextEditor)
- **Location**: `client/components/RichTextEditor.tsx` (if still used)
- **Note**: CKEditor is now the default editor, so this issue may already be resolved
- **Required Action**: Verify RichTextEditor is not being used anywhere

### 6. **Required Fields Progress Indicator**
- **Issue**: Progress indicator shows 6/6 but validation still fails
- **Location**: `client/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` (lines 3295-3331)
- **Problem**: The indicator counts different fields than the actual validation
- **Required Action**: 
  - Align progress indicator with actual validation requirements
  - Ensure all required fields are properly tracked
